# AI agents LLMs and RAGs

## Overview

This repository is a collection of projects focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically exploring AI Agents, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The goal is to provide practical implementations, experiments, and learning resources for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in cutting-edge AI technologies.

---
## Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

* **AI_Agents:** Projects related to autonomous AI agents capable of decision-making, task execution, and interaction with environments.

* **LLMs:** Implementations and experiments with large language models, including fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and inference.

* **RAGs:** Projects leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation for combining LLMs with external knowledge bases for enhanced responses.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0792211827/AI_agents_LLMs_RAG.git
   cd AI_agents_LLMs_RAG
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
```

3. Navigate to the desired directory (AI_Agents, LLMs, or RAGs) and follow the specific README instructions.


4. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., Python 3.10+, Transformers, etc.). Refer to individual project READMEs for details.


5. Make sure .env includes your keys:
```bash
   PINECONE_API_KEY=...
   OPENAI_API_KEY=...
   GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```
